### Introduction
The goal of this project is to explore how we can synthesize data about countries to understand more about issues of human rights and their implications. In the analysis so far, I specifically use data on military aid as a proxy to understand how the United States does or does not advocate for human rights in its international relations. 

Through this analysis, we may be able to notice correlations between certain social, political, or societal factors, and predict other tangible measures of human rights such as disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and so on. We also can build a better understanding for how human rights interacts with US international military strategy, and work to detect bias in actions by the United States.
